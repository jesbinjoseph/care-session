# CARE local deployment session

A training repository for building and running a complete CARE instance locally with Docker Compose. The stack is intentionally small enough to teach while retaining the CARE application roles and supporting dependencies.

See [Architecture explanation](docs/architecture.md) for the Markdown and Mermaid view of the local system.

## Teaching progression

Start with the local diagram until participants can explain the two CARE images, runtime roles, and dependency responsibilities. Then introduce the same application model on a simple Kubernetes cluster:

- [CARE on a simple Kubernetes cluster](docs/kubernetes-local-architecture.md)

Finally, replace each local platform capability with its GCP equivalent using [From local Compose to GCP](docs/local-to-gcp.md).

The [current OpenTofu-managed GCP architecture](docs/gcp-current-architecture.md) keeps the CARE application roles recognizable while moving durable data to managed GCP services. The cache and task broker remain a Helm-managed workload inside GKE.

The [recommended managed-services GCP architecture](docs/gcp-managed-architecture.md) goes one step further by moving the compatible cache and broker capability to a managed GCP service.

## What runs

| Service | Purpose | Source or image |
|---|---|---|
| `frontend` | CARE browser application | Built from `ohcnetwork/care_fe` |
| `backend` | Django API and business logic | Built from `ohcnetwork/care` |
| `worker` | Celery asynchronous task processing | Same image as backend |
| `beat` | Startup initialization and scheduled-task dispatch | Same image as backend |
| `db` | PostgreSQL application database | `postgres:17-alpine` |
| `redis` | Cache and Celery message broker | `redis:8-alpine` |
| `silo` | Local S3-compatible object storage | `pgsty/silo` |
| Plugs | Backend extensions | Installed into the backend image at build time |

## Two CARE application images

The workshop builds two CARE images from the official repositories:

1. **Frontend image:** the `care_fe` Node build reads the `REACT_*` build environment, including `REACT_CARE_API_URL`. It generates static HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. The final image uses Nginx to serve those files.
2. **Backend image:** the `care` build receives `ADDITIONAL_PLUGS`, downloads the selected plug packages, and installs them into the image. The same image runs the API, worker, and Beat processes.

Changing a frontend build variable requires rebuilding the frontend image. Changing the plug list requires rebuilding the backend image. Database, S3, and cache/broker settings used by the backend remain runtime configuration.

## Why the backend processes share one image

The API, worker, and Beat scheduler run the same CARE code. Compose changes only the process entry point:

- API: `start.sh`
- Worker: `celery_worker.sh`
- Scheduler and startup initialization: `celery_beat.sh`

The current CARE `celery_beat.sh` waits for PostgreSQL and Redis, runs migrations, compiles messages, synchronizes permissions and value sets, marks itself healthy, and then starts Celery Beat. There is no separate initialization container.

This is the central deployment concept: one tested application artifact can run different roles.

## Prerequisites

- Git
- Docker Desktop or Docker Engine
- Docker Compose v2 (`docker compose version`)
- At least 8 GB of free memory recommended
- Free ports: `4000`, `9000`, `9001`, and `9100`

## 1. Clone this repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jesbinjoseph/care-session.git
cd care-session
```

## 2. Clone CARE source repositories

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch develop https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care.git
git clone --depth 1 --branch develop https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe.git
```

The source directories are intentionally excluded from this repository. Participants can see exactly which upstream source is being built.

## 3. Create local configuration

```bash
cp .env.example .env
cp frontend.env.production.local care_fe/.env.production.local
```

The frontend setting points the participant's browser to `http://localhost:9000`. Container-to-container dependencies use Compose service names such as `db`, `redis`, and `silo`.

## 4. Review the resolved stack

```bash
docker compose config --services
docker compose config
```

Expected services:

```text
db
redis
silo
backend
worker
beat
frontend
```

## 5. Build and start CARE

```bash
docker compose up -d --build --wait
```

The first run takes longer because Docker downloads base images and builds both CARE repositories. Beat completes migrations and synchronization before becoming healthy; the backend and worker wait for that health signal.

## 6. Verify the deployment

```bash
docker compose ps -a
curl -f http://localhost:9000/ping/
curl -I http://localhost:4000/
docker compose exec backend python manage.py check
```

Expected endpoints:

| Endpoint | URL |
|---|---|
| CARE frontend | http://localhost:4000 |
| Backend health | http://localhost:9000/ping/ |
| API documentation | http://localhost:9000/swagger/ |
| Silo object-storage console | http://localhost:9001 |

## 7. Load synthetic workshop data

```bash
docker compose exec backend python manage.py load_fixtures
```

Use only fixture accounts and synthetic records. Never enter production credentials or patient data into this environment.

## 8. Follow each flow

### Browser request

```text
Browser → frontend → backend → PostgreSQL
```

### File upload

```text
Browser → backend → Silo
```

### Background task

```text
Backend → Redis → worker → PostgreSQL or Silo
```

### Scheduled task

```text
Beat → Redis → worker
```

Inspect logs while demonstrating:

```bash
docker compose logs -f frontend backend
docker compose logs -f worker beat
docker compose logs -f db redis silo
```

## Backend plugs

CARE plugs are Django extensions. They are installed into the shared backend image during the Docker build and can add models, API routes, and Celery tasks. They are not a separate container.

Core CARE uses:

```env
ADDITIONAL_PLUGS=[]
```

A plug configuration follows this structure:

```env
ADDITIONAL_PLUGS=[{"name":"my_plugin","package_name":"git+https://github.com/example/my_plugin.git","version":"@v1.0.0","configs":{}}]
```

Use the exact package and configuration documented by the selected plug. Pin a release or commit; do not use a floating branch. Rebuild after changing plugs:

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache backend worker beat
docker compose up -d --wait
```

Do not place plug secrets inside `ADDITIONAL_PLUGS`. Supply required values separately through the local environment.

## Stop and restart

Stop containers while preserving local data:

```bash
docker compose down
```

Start again:

```bash
docker compose up -d --wait
```

Delete all local data and start from an empty environment:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```

`down -v` permanently removes the workshop database, Redis data, and object-storage volume.

## Troubleshooting

### Docker daemon unavailable

Start Docker Desktop or the Docker daemon, then verify:

```bash
docker info
docker compose version
```

### A service is unhealthy

```bash
docker compose ps -a
docker compose logs --tail=200 <service>
```

Check dependencies in this order: `db`, `redis`, `silo`, `beat`, `backend`, `worker`, and `frontend`.

### Rebuild after source or plug changes

```bash
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d --force-recreate --wait
```

### Reset the workshop

```bash
docker compose down -v
docker compose up -d --build --wait
```

## Production boundary

This repository is a learning environment, not a production deployment template. Production additionally requires:

- Managed secrets and controlled rotation
- TLS, DNS, load balancing, Gateway, and routing policy
- Private networking and workload identities
- Durable managed PostgreSQL and object storage
- Multiple replicas, resource policies, and disruption controls
- Centralized logs, metrics, dashboards, and alerts
- Tested backup, restore, rollback, and recovery procedures
- Pinned and approved release artifacts

## Workshop website

Use the [guided CARE deployment workshop](https://jesbinjoseph.github.io/care-session/) during the session. It includes presenter mode, copyable commands, local verification, architecture diagrams, the local-to-GCP transition, and the production readiness gate.
